v0.16.0   2017-02-10 14:45:46-08:00 America/Los_Angeles

	+ Added support for Excel cell XML value types ('t' attribute)
        'b' => forced into 1 or 0 with an exists style test
        'd' => will show as a 'Date' cell type
        'inlineStr' => handled just like a formula 'str'  (set to the 'Text' type)
        'n' => this seems redundant because generally Excel just doesn't store 't' for numbers but it behaves the same way
    ! Upgraded debug support to use Log::Shiras::Unhide
