=head1 NAME

Spreadsheet::Reader::ExcelXML::XMLReader::WorksheetToRow - Builds row objects from 
worksheet files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See t\Spreadsheet\Reader\ExcelXML\09-worksheet_to_row.t
    
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This documentation is written to explain ways to use this module when writing your own 
excel parser.  To use the general package for excel parsing out of the box please review 
the documentation for L<Workbooks|Spreadsheet::Reader::ExcelXML>,
L<Worksheets|Spreadsheet::Reader::ExcelXML::Worksheet>, and 
L<Cells|Spreadsheet::Reader::ExcelXML::Cell>

This module provides the generic connection to individual worksheet files (not chartsheets) 
for parsing xlsx(and xml) workbooks.  It does not provide a way to connect to L<chartsheets
|Spreadsheet::Reader::ExcelXML::Chartsheet>.  It does not provide the final view of a given 
cell.  The final view of the cell is collated with the role (Interface) 
L<Spreadsheet::Reader::ExcelXML::Worksheet>.  This reader extends the base reader class 
L<Spreadsheet::Reader::ExcelXML::XMLReader>.  This module also uses a file type interpreter.  
The functionality provided by those modules is not explained here.

For now this module reads each full row (with values) into a L<Spreadsheet::Reader::ExcelXML::Row> 
instance.  It stores either the currently read row or all rows based on the 
L<Spreadsheet::Reader::ExcelXML/cache_positions> setting for Worksheet_instance.  
When a position past the end of the sheet is called the current row is cleared and an 'EOF' 
or undef value is returned.  See L<Spreadsheet::Reader::ExcelXML/file_boundary_flags> for 
more details.

I<All positions (row and column places and integers) at this level are stored and returned in count 
from one mode!>
	
To replace this part in the package look in the raw code of 
L<Spreadsheet::Reader::ExcelXML::Workbook> and adjust the 'worksheet_interface' key of the 
$parser_modules variable.

=head2 requires

This module is a L<role|Moose::Manual::Roles> and as such only adds incremental methods and 
attributes to some base class.  In order to use this role some base object methods are 
required.  The requirments are listed below with links to the default provider.

=over

L<Spreadsheet::Reader::ExcelXML::FileWorksheet/advance_row_position( $element, [$iterations] )>

L<Spreadsheet::Reader::ExcelXML::FileWorksheet/build_row_data>

L<Spreadsheet::Reader::ExcelXML::XMLReader/not_end_of_file>

L<Spreadsheet::Reader::ExcelXML::XMLReader/start_the_file_over>

L<Spreadsheet::Reader::ExcelXML::XMLReader/close_the_file>

=back

=head2 Attributes

Data passed to new when creating an instance.  For access to the values in these 
attributes see the listed 'attribute methods'. For general information on attributes see 
L<Moose::Manual::Attributes>.  For ways to manage the instance when opened see the 
L<Methods|/Methods>.
	
=head3 cache_positions

=over

B<Definition:> This is a boolean value which controls whether the parser caches rows that 
have been parsed or just stores the top level hash.  In general this should repsond to the 
top level attribute L<Spreadsheet::Reader::ExcelXML/cache_positions>

B<Default:> 1 = caching on

B<Range:> (1|0)

B<attribute methods> Methods provided to adjust this attribute
		
=over

B<should_cache_positions>

=over

B<Definition:> return the attribute value

=back

=back

=head2 Methods

These are the methods provided by this class for use within the package but are not intended 
to be used by the end user.  Other private methods not listed here are used in the module but 
not used by the package.  If the private method is listed here then replacement of this module 
either requires replacing them or rewriting all the associated connecting roles and classes.

=head3 has_new_row_inst

=over

B<Definition:> Generally in the processing of a worksheet file there will be a currently 
active row.  This row is stored as an object so elements of the row can be retrieved via 
L<delegation|Moose::Manual::Delegation/NATIVE DELEGATION>

B<Accepts:> nothing

B<Returns:> (1|0) depending on the presence of a currently stored row

=back

=head3 get_new_row_number

=over

B<Definition:> This returns the row number (in count from 1 mode) for the currently stored 
row.

B<Accepts:> nothing

B<Returns:> an integer $row

=back

=head3 get_new_column( $column )

=over

B<Definition:> This returns the column data for the selected $column.  If the request is 
for a column with no data then it returns undef.  If the column is requested pased the 
last column with data but before the end of the span it returns 'EOD'.  If the request is 
for a column past the end of the span it returns 'EOF'.  THe request and return are all 
handled in count from 1 context.

B<Accepts:> an integer $column number

B<Returns:> The cell contents for that column (or undef, 'EOD', or 'EOF')

=back

=head3 get_new_next_value

=over

B<Definition:> like get_new_column this will return one cell.  However, this method 
will only return cells with content or 'EOR'.  The role keeps track of which one 
was called last even it it was through get_new_column.

B<Accepts:> nothing

B<Returns:> the cell contents or 'EOR'

=back

=head3 get_new_row_all

=over

B<Definition:> This is returns an array ref of each of the values in the current row placed 
in their 'count from 0' position.

B<Accepts:> nothing

B<Returns:> an array ref

=back

=head3 go_to_or_past_row( $row )

=over

B<Definition:> This will attempt to advance to the row provided by $row.  It will continue to 
advance past that row until it arrives at a row with values or the end of the file.

B<Accepts:> $row (integer in count from 1 context)

B<Returns:> The actual row number that was arrived at (in count from 1 context)

=back

=head1 SUPPORT

=over

L<github Spreadsheet::Reader::ExcelXML/issues
|https://github.com/jandrew/p5-spreadsheet-reader-excelxml/issues>

=back

=head1 TODO

=over

B<1.> If a the primary cell of a merge range is hidden show that value 
in the top left unhidden cell even when the attribute
L<Spreadsheet::Reader::ExcelXML::Workbook/spread_merged_values> is not 
set.  (This is the way excel does it(ish))
